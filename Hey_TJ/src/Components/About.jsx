        <h2>Part Journal, Part Archive, Part Assistant</h2>
        <p>Let me show you how it works</p>

        <div className="steps">
            <h2>1</h2>
            <h3>Create a new journal</h3>
            <p>
                <span className="highlight">Hey TJ!</span> Open a new journal!
            </p>
            <p>
                Give the journal a breif but descriptive name, such as "Eurotrip", "Appalachian Trail Hike", "Hichiking South America". It should remind you of your trip as a whole.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2</h2>
            <h3>Give some details about your journal</h3>
            <p>
                Here, you'll tweak some settings, like if you want to show your adventures to everyone, or keep it private, as well as toggle if your trip is ongoing or complete. Don't worry, you'll always be able to edit these
            </p>

            <h2>3</h2>
            <h3>Add your entries</h3>
            <p>
                Now let's get into details! Each entry can describe and event. You can choose to name these by the city you're in, or day by day. How vague or specific is totally up to you. You can add things like photos, weather, travel type, dates and more. Lastly, just add as much or as little as you'd like to talk about this leg of your adventure. From nothing, to a sentance, to a long-form article. The choice is yours!
            </p>
            <h2>4</h2>
            <h3>Save and browse</h3>
            <p>
                When your trip is complete, it'll always live on here for you to go through and tweak whenever you'd like. View and reminisce forever!
